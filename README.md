# Simple Snake Game in Pygame

This is a classic Snake game implemented using the Pygame library in Python.

## Description

This project is a simple and fun implementation of the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

## Key Features

* Classic Snake gameplay mechanics.
* Simple and intuitive controls.
* Score tracking.
* Basic game over condition.
* Randomly generated food placement.

## How to Run

To play this game, you need to have Python and the Pygame library installed on your system.

**Prerequisites:**

* **Python 3:** Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **Pygame:** Install Pygame using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

**Running the Game:**

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**

    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY]
    ```

    *(Replace `[YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository and `[YOUR_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY]` with the name of the cloned directory.)*

2.  **Navigate to the game directory (if needed).**
3.  **Run the game script:**

    ```bash
    python your_snake_game_script_name.py
    ```

    *(Replace `your_snake_game_script_name.py` with the actual name of your main Python file containing the Snake game code.)*

## Controls

* **Up Arrow:** Move the snake up.
* **Down Arrow:** Move the snake down.
* **Left Arrow:** Move the snake left.
* **Right Arrow:** Move the snake right.
* **[Optional: Mention any other controls, like a pause key if implemented]**

## Potential Enhancements (Optional)

Here are some ideas for future improvements to the game:

* Different difficulty levels (changing the speed of the snake or the size of the grid).
* More sophisticated scoring system.
* Obstacles on the game board.
* Different types of food with varying point values or effects.
* Sound effects and background music.
* A graphical user interface (GUI) for the start and game over screens.
